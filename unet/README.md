# Implement UNet From Scratch


## Overview
The UNet architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks. This implementation includes training and validation scripts, as well as utilities for data handling and model evaluation.

### Unet Arch
The unet arch is referenced from the origin unet paper. "U-Net:Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation". But there also exists a little difference.

- I **use the same conv** instead of valid-conv in the double-conv-block. This can ensure the output size same as the input size.
- More activation functions are explored here. Such as: relu, gelu, silu. I also **define a new activation function** named 'PySiLU' which mean the polynomial version of silu.
- **Center-Crop is used** in the skip connections between down block and up block.

### PySiLU activation
This is a activation defined by myself. It has a function curve similar to SiLU.
<p align='center'><img src='imgs/pysilu_curve.png'></p>

The formula of this activation is as follows:

$$pysilu(x) = \begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
\frac{x}{1+x^2} & \text{if } x < 0 
\end{cases}$$


See the codes in `activation.py`. Uncomment the line `# utils.show_activation_curve(pysilu)`. You can get this figure by run: `python activation.py`

## Requirments

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- Albumentations
- tqdm
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- Pandas

## Usage
1. Clone the reposity:
   ```bash
   git clone ~
   cd Unet-From-Scratch
   ```
2. Install dependecies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download dataset from <a herf="">Kaggle</a>.
4. Prepare you train data and test data with `process_data.py`. This will output two csv file under the data directory(train_desc.csv, test_desc.csv). But you can also use my files.
5. Make necessary directories.
   ```bash
   mkdir imgs
   mkdir metric_logs
   ```
6. Train you model. Check the parameters in `train.py` and then run `python train.py`.

## Some Metrics

### Accuracy
The formula of accuracy is as follows:

$$ acc = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN} $$

I assume that you all know this metric. So there is no more introduce about accuracy.

### Dice-score
The formula of accuracy is as follows:

$$ dice=\frac{2\times TP}{2\times TP + FP + FN} $$

Here is a implementation of dice-score with pytorch.

```python
def dice_score(pred, mask):
    up = 2 * (pred * mask).sum()
    down = (pred + mask).sum()
    return up / down
```

The idea is:
- `pred * mask` is the result of 'logical and' of pred and mask. By summing it, you get the `TP` value.
- Give an example: `pred=Tensor([1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]), mask=Tensor([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])`. By excute `pred + mask`, you can get a result `Tensor([2.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2.0])`. If the value of `pred[i]` and `mask[i]` are both `1` (that means this is a true positive case), you can get `2` by executing `pred + mask`. This is sames as `2*TP`. If the value of `pred[i]` and `mask[i]` are both `0` (that means this is a true negative case), you can get `0` which will contribute nothing. But, If the value of `pred[i]` and `mask[i]` is `1` or `0` (that means this is a false positive or false negative case), you can get `1` by executing `pred + mask`. This is same as `FP + FN`. 

## Experiment

### Dice Score
Run experiment 5 epochs with random seed 20. 

| Activation | Train Dice Score | Eval Dice Score |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----------:|
| ReLU| 0.9552 | 0.9295 |
| GeLU| 0.9559 | 0.9629 |
| SiLU| 0.9556 | 0.9601 |
| PySiLU| 0.9545 | 0.9602 |

The figure is dice score curve with different activation function in 5 epochs. **One can see that the ReLU activation function appears to exhibit suboptimal performance.**
